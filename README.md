## Description 
I have created an application that allows users to search for cities and be presented with the current weather and five day forecast. This app utilizes HTML, CSS, jQuery, and server-side API elements. 

## Installation
Clone the repo, and run the files in browser. 

## Usage 
They are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index.  When the user views the UV index, they are presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. I am also presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity.
